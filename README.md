# Automated Coding Challenges Solutions
This repository contains implementations and optimized solutions for various coding challenges across multiple programming languages: Java, C, C++, Ada, and Shell Scripting. The solutions are aimed at tackling common algorithmic problems and improving efficiency using appropriate data structures and algorithms.

## Overview
The project includes solutions to coding problems, tested and verified by an automated scoring system. Each challenge is implemented with a focus on:
- Algorithm Efficiency
- Data Structures: Linked lists, sorting inversions, and more.
- Dynamic Programming: Problems like the knapsack problem and 2D subarrays.
- Numerical Methods: Solutions to problems such as postfix-infix conversions and tax processing.
- System-Level Programming: Solutions using lower-level system operations.
